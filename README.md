## 📌 Introduction

This project is a **real-time voice recognition system** designed to continuously capture audio through a microphone, convert it into text, and update that text live in memory for use by other modules or systems.

It's built for developers looking to add voice input to their applications in a lightweight, modular, and scalable way — such as for virtual assistants, automation agents, or accessibility tools.

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level Overview)

- The system continuously listens to audio using the device microphone.
- Captured audio is sent to a **speech-to-text engine** (Google Speech Recognition API) to transcribe spoken words.
- The transcribed text is stored in memory and updated **only when the recognized phrase changes**.
- **Threading and queuing** ensure that the listening and processing tasks happen in real-time, without blocking each other.
- Built-in noise calibration helps improve recognition in varied environments.
- Logging is integrated for monitoring or debugging without interfering with recognition.

> ✅ No external interface is needed — the entire flow runs in the background and can be accessed programmatically.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎙️ **Always-On Listening** – Starts listening automatically, no manual trigger needed.
- ⚙️ **Multithreaded Processing** – Separate threads handle listening and recognition to avoid delays.
- 🔁 **Live Text Update** – Captures and updates the latest spoken command or sentence.
- 📦 **In-Memory Queue System** – Handles streaming audio input smoothly.
- 📉 **Ambient Noise Calibration** – Adjusts sensitivity for more accurate recognition.
- 🧱 **Thread-Safe Architecture** – Prevents race conditions when reading or updating text.

## 💡 Why Use This?

- **Ideal for Assistants & Automation** – Especially useful in systems that react to voice commands in real-time.
- **Lightweight** – No bloated libraries, minimal dependencies.
- **Easy to Integrate** – Can be used as a backend speech module in larger applications.
- **Transparent Logic** – Simple, maintainable structure using native Python features.

## ✅ Advantages

- ✔️ Runs in the background without user input
- ✔️ Recognizes natural language in real-time
- ✔️ Simple to start and stop
- ✔️ Easy to extend for command handling or AI processing

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❗ Requires internet (relies on Google’s API)
- ❗ Does not support offline recognition
- ❗ Basic speech-to-text only (no natural language understanding built-in)
